# Automatic-Power-Factor-Correction-Device
Power factor is a ratio of real power and apparent power. Ideal power factor is unity. Pure resistive loads have unity power factor. But there is no such load exist. So we always try to make power factor close to unity.  reactive power is also reason of low power factor. Inductive loads absorb reactive power and capacitive loads provides reactive power. So capacitor banks are used to improve power factor in power factor correction circuit. By connecting capacitor banks parallel to load, power factor is increased. capacitor provides reactive power locally to load instead of getting from generators or power system which in return induces burden in power system. This is main objective of automatic power factor controller.
